Downloading anime episodes can be a hassle, especially from websites filled with ads and pop-ups. To streamline this process, I've developed a script that simplifies the task.



## How It Works
This script takes an anime URL from [Witanime](https://zf.witanime.website/) and the desired episodes to download, automating the installation process.

  1- Episode Retrieval: The script scans the website to extract all available episode URLs.
  2- Google Drive Links: It then locates the Google Drive links embedded in the website and decodes them.
  3- Downloading: Finally, the script initiates the download process for the specified episodes.



For every 5 episodes, it took me 15 minutes to install. However, the entire script took 30 minutes to build. Now, I simply run the script before sleeping, effortlessly obtaining all the episodes I desire without any hassle.
So, if you're as lazy as I am, feel free to utilize it! :)
